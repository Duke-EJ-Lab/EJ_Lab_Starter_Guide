# Onboarding {-}

## Lab structure {-}

The lab consists of two Principal Investigators (PIs): Chris Timmins (a professor in Econ) and Kay Jowers (the Director of the Just Environments program at the Nicholas Institute). There's currently a staff Analyst, Anne Driscoll. 

Everybody meets once a week in person so we can all get a sense of what's going on with everyone in the lab. Meetings start with a rose/bud/thorn check-in, followed by a presentation by a lab member, a lit review by another lab member, and a factoid or figure share by a third lab member. 

Mostly, each student is working on one project in collaboration with one or both of the PIs on a relatively long term basis. Research meetings between the lab PIs and students help define the structure and goals of the project, help to move research forward and troubleshoot things that come up throughout the process, but most work happens pretty independently. 

## Code Organization {-}

Code for lab projects all lives in the [**lab GitHub**](https://github.com/Duke-EJ-Lab). Many of the repos discussed below are set to only be accessible to members of the GitHub lab group, so be sure to request access. 

### Individual Code Organization {-}

Each lab project will have it's own GitHub repository, which should be reproducible by people within lab. All lab projects start from a [reproducible project template](https://github.com/Duke-EJ-Lab/reproducible_project_template). Starting all projects from this file structure gives a framework that helps make our data and code more uniform, helping with reproducibility and keeping institutional knowledge as students join and leave projects.

This template is set up with example R files, but the same ideas apply regardless of the language you're using. The template repo itself documents what should go in what folder, and includes examples of documentation and commenting throughout code files. An example of the template in use is the [COVID housing precarity](https://github.com/Duke-EJ-Lab/covid_housing_precarity) repo. External examples for how a publishable repo can look: [The Changing Risk and Burden of Wildfire in the United States](https://github.com/echolab-stanford/wildfire-map-public). 

Once you have access to the lab GitHub, you should be able to create repositories for each of your own projects. Details on that can be found in the [section on starting a project](#startup).

### Lab Code Organization {-}

There are two communal GitHub code repositories to know about: 

* The [lab.tools](https://github.com/Duke-EJ-Lab/lab.tools) repo, which is an R package that everyone can add to and use in their code. You can find more information about how to contribute in the workflow section. It contains some helpful little functions like `detach_all_packages()` that lets you quickly wipe all the loaded functions from your environment - as well as some helpful analysis functions like `merge_verbose()` which wraps the normal merge function but outputs some info on the success of the merge or `simplify_and_combine_shapefiles()` which takes in a vector of file paths, simplifies the shapefiles and returns a master file, which is useful when data is served at a state level. 
    * You can install the lab.tools package through first loading the `devtools` package, then running `install_github("Duke-EJ-Lab/lab.tools")`. Then just load as a normal library using `library(lab.tools)`.
* The [general_cleaning](https://github.com/Duke-EJ-Lab/general_cleaning) repo, which serves to ensure we know the origin of all our communal lab data. There's more information about how to interact with the repo in the workflow section. 

In addition to the code repositories, this [EJ_Lab_Starter_Guide](https://github.com/Duke-EJ-Lab/EJ_Lab_Starter_Guide) repo is something you can access and update. Details on how to do that are in the [guide](#guide) section. 


## Data Storage {-}

Lab data is stored ***only*** be in Duke Box, or one of the lab VM's - not a personal computer, not dropbox, not a hard drive under the desk in Kay's office. To get access to both of these, talk to Kay. 

### Box {-#box}

The EJ Lab Box has three main folders, `projects`, `clean`, and `raw`. 

1) `raw` is effectively a read-only folder. Data is added relatively rarely and it's important when things are added to the raw folder to document well **when** the data was downloaded, **how** to obtain the data (a link to download/an email for who to contact to get access), and **what** the data means (a data dictionary). More details about the exact way to do this are in the [workflow section](#databank).

2) `clean` holds processed data that you might want to directly pull into a project. For something to get added to clean a few conditions need to be met: the raw data is in the `raw` folder, and the code that cleans it is in the lab `cleaning` github. This is only for data that might be useful for someone else on a different lab project. A dataset to include might be: the average PM for every year 2000-2020 for each county in the contiguous US. A dataset not to include might be: a panel that includes 21 day rolling mean county level PM observation that you built to purpose for a model. 

3) `projects` is the folder that contains a folder for each active or completed project. While we'd recommend a structure that at least separates your `raw` data, `clean` data and any `docs` files you have (eg literature reviews, research updates, other notes to self, etc) - this is a space each RA can do whatever they please with. 


Below is a minimal representation of what the Box structure looks like. 

```

 │	 ├── polidata
 │	 └── pm25
 └── raw
  	 ├── boundaries
     ├── rsei
     ├── polidata
     └── pm25
```

### VM's {-}

There are a few datasets that should only exist on **Duke owned machines** (the VM's) or (if they have even higher protections) that can only exist in the **protected research data network** (PRDN). Information on getting access to those spaces can be found in the onboarding section. This includes the original datasets, and ANY data that is created from it/combined with it/modeled using it, excluding simple tables that might be need to go in a publication. The datasets currently used in lab that these protections apply to are: 

* InfoUSA

For projects that work with a protected dataset, most of the work will occur on the VM itself. This doesn't change the workflow very much as all the tools we work through (Box and GitHub Desktop) are available through the VM as well. 

## Basics of GitHub {-}

Though it's much more complicated and has tons of more intricate use cases, at it's most basic we can think of git as similar to Box. A file exists in Box in the cloud, and sometimes also exists on your local computer. You can make changes on your computer, and that can change what's in the cloud (and therefore what's on your friend's computer). 

GitHub uses "repositories" (repos) as buckets that contain individual projects. 

Git is a little more manual than Box though! You have to manually let it know when to take action - and there are 3 actions you need to know about.

A **commit** is basically like saving your progress. You're telling git to pay attention and create a save point of what's changed since you last committed. This is the building block of a repo, each commit should be a bite sized change in your work.

A **push** is sending your commits to the cloud. Until you do this, your commits only exist on your computer, and if your colleagues look at your online GitHub repo nothing will have changed. 

A **pull** is telling Git to check if anyone else has changed the online repo, and updating what's on your computer to match. 

That's pretty much all you need to know to get started, and you'll see more about **commits** and **pushing** in the next section. In our usage, we'll always talk about commiting then immediately pushing afterwards, since not doing so can cause complications. From here on we're describing GitHub through the desktop app because that's the easiest way to learn about GitHub.
