## Code Organization {-}

Code for lab projects all lives in the [**lab GitHub**](https://github.com/Duke-EJ-Lab). Many of the repos discussed below are set to only be accessible to members of the GitHub lab group, so be sure to request access. 

### Individual Code Organization {-}

All lab projects start from a [reproducible project template](https://github.com/Duke-EJ-Lab/reproducible_project_template). Starting all projects from this file structure gives a framework that helps make our data and code more uniform, helping with reproducibility and keeping institutional knowledge as students join and leave projects.

This template is set up with example R files, but the same ideas apply regardless of the language you're using. The template repo itself documents what should go in what folder, and includes examples of documentation and commenting throughout code files. An example of the template in use is the [COVID housing precarity](https://github.com/Duke-EJ-Lab/covid_housing_precarity) repo. Some external examples for how a publishable repo can look like: a paper called [The Changing Risk and Burden of Wildfire in the United States](https://github.com/echolab-stanford/wildfire-map-public), . 

### Lab Code Organization {-}

There are two communal code repositories to know about: 

* The [lab.tools]() repo, which is an R package that everyone can add to and use in their code. You can find more information about how to contribute in the workflow section. It contains some helpful little functions like `detach_all_packages()` that lets you quickly wipe all the loaded functions from your environment - as well as some helpful analysis functions like `merge_verbose()` which wraps the normal merge function but outputs some info on the success of the merge or `simplify_and_combine_shapefiles()` which takes in a vector of file paths, simplifies the shapefiles and returns a master file, which is useful when data is served at a state level.
* The [general_cleaning]() repo, which serves to ensure we know the origin of all our communal lab data. There's more information about how to interact with the repo in the workflow section. 


## Data Storage {-}

Lab data is stored ***only*** be in Duke Box, or one of the lab VM's - not a personal computer, not dropbox, not a hard drive under the desk in Kay's office. 

### Box {-#box}

The EJ Lab Box has three main folders, `projects`, `clean`, and `raw`. 

1) `raw` is effectively a read-only folder. Data is added relatively rarely and it's important when things are added to the raw folder to document well **when** the data was downloaded, **how** to obtain the data (a link to download/an email for who to contact to get access), and **what** the data means (a data dictionary). More details about the exact way to do this are in the [workflow section](#workflow).

2) `clean` holds processed data that you might want to directly pull into a project. For something to get added to clean a few conditions need to be met: the raw data is in the `raw` folder, and the code that cleans it is in the lab `cleaning` github. This is only for data that might be useful for someone else on a different lab project. A dataset to include might be: the average PM for every year 2000-2020 for each county in the contiguous US. A dataset not to include might be: a panel that includes 21 day rolling mean county level PM observation that you built to purpose for a model. 

3) `projects` is the folder that contains a folder for each active or archived project. While we'd recommend a structure that at least separates your `raw` data, `clean` data and any `docs` files you have (eg literature reviews, research updates, other notes to self, etc) - this is a space you can do whatever you please with. 


Below is a minimal representation of what the Box structure looks like.

### VM's {-}

There are a few datasets that should only exist on **Duke owned machines** (the VM's) or (if they have even higher protections) that can only exist in the **protected research data network** (PRDN). Information on getting access to those spaces can be found in the onboarding section. This includes the original datasets, and ANY data that is created from it/combined with it/modeled using it, excluding simple tables that might be need to go in a publication. The datasets currently used in lab that these protections apply to are: 

* InfoUSA
* Corelogic
