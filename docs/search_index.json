The data helps “explore data on releases of toxic substances from industrial and federal facilities. RSEI incorporates information from the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) on the amount of toxic chemicals released, together with factors such as the chemical’s fate and transport through the environment, each chemical’s relative toxicity, and potential human exposure.” Using the repoted chemical releases combined with the fate and transport models lets us know where people are exposed to those chemical releases. raw/rsei/chemical_data_rsei_v2310.csv Cleaned formats: NA What: “The chemical table contains data [on which are] chemicals reported to TRI, including toxicity, physico-chemical properties, and flag fields to facilitate user selections. The chemical table is also available in EasyRSEI.” Data dictionary Where: Download When: 09/26/22 raw/rsei/facility_data_rsei_v2310.csv Cleaned formats: NA What: “The facility table contains data for reporting facilities, including location, stack parameters and discharge reach, and is also available in EasyRSEI.” Data dictionary Where: Download When: 09/26/22 raw/rsei/blockgroup Cleaned formats: Processed versions of the RSEI data exist at the blockgroup, tract, and county levels. Because of reporting requirements, if you’re using RSEI in any timeseries you need to drop certain observations so that there aren’t huge jumps in years where reporting requirements change - currently data is only processed for the consistent set of chemicals that exists starting in 2011. There is code in the general_cleaning GitHub that would allow you to clean for other year sets in case your year is prior to 2011. The data follows the naming convention RSEI_[geographic level]_year[AAAA]_consistent[BBBB]_lower48.csv, where geographic level is either “blockgroup”, “tract” or “county”, AAAA is the four digit year for which the RSEI data is pulled, and BBBB is the four digit year that the chemicals are consistent for. BBBB should never be a year that came after AAAA. Lower 48 indicates the data does not include HI + AK or territories.

Each observation in the data is a spill of a specific chemical in a specific blockgroup, with accompanying information on the part of the spill relevant to the blockgroup. Important to consider that each row is NOT the entirety of a spill, NOT the entirety of the toxicity in the blockgroup and NOT the entirety of the impact of a facility, though you can aggregate to investigate spills, blockgroups or facilities. This documentation is helpful in thinking through what the data is and what is an appropriate interpretation. Spatial Resolution + Coverage: Each observation is the impact at the blockgroup level, for all US blockgroups. Temporal Resolution + Coverage: Each file is named censusmicroblockgroup2020_[YYYY].csv, where the YYYY indicates the year of coverage. It can only be interpreted at the year level, there’s no way to break up further temporally. Where: Download When: Downloaded 10/9/2022. PM 2.5 raw/pm25/V4NA03 Cleaned formats: Processed versions of the PM2.5 data exists at the county level for 2000-2018. Currently, there is only a version for 2010 county boundaries. There is code in the general_cleaning GitHub that could be adapted to clean for other shapefiles. The data follows the naming convention pm[AAAA]_county[BBBB].csv, where AAAA is the four digit year for which the pm data is pulled, and BBBB is the four digit year that the county boundaries are from. All data from the V4NA03 dataset is for the lower 48, aka not including HI + AK or territories.

The data we have pre-loaded is specifically for North America, and only covers the contiguous 48, if you need Alaska and Hawaii, or international data you’ll need to download their Global/Regional Estimates (V5.GL.02). Temporal Resolution + Coverage: The PM 2.5 data that lives in Box currently covers 2018-2000 and is at a yearly average level. Where: Information on the different products can be found here.
